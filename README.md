## Hey tech enthusiasts! 

- ðŸš€ I'm Sayanti Chowdhury, currently riding the coding wave while pursuing my CSE degree at Chittagong Independent University. Picture this: a caffeine-fueled coder with a penchant for turning coffee into code.

- When I'm not lost in the binary cosmos, you can find me on Twitter @sayantichy, dropping tech wisdom and maybe a few coding memes. Let's connect there â€“ because who says tech can't be fun?

- LinkedIn? Oh, you bet! Find the professional side of me at (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sayantichy/). My virtual door is always open for collaborations, discussions, and the occasional cat GIF.

- Now, let's talk tech cravings. AI, ML, DevOps â€“ my daily dose of excitement! I thrive on challenges, armed with a coding arsenal including C, C++, Python, and Java. Think of me as a tech wizard, brewing spells in different programming languages.

** Join me on this wild ride through the bytes and pixels. Together, let's code our way to a future where bugs are mythical creatures, and tech dreams come true! ðŸš€âœ¨
